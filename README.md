# Waste Item Classification with RealWaste Dataset
The RealWaste dataset was developed as part of an honors thesis exploring the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on genuine waste materials. The dataset includes objects in their pure forms and compares the efficacy of CNNs when trained on authentic waste items.

**Class Labels:**
* Cardboard
* Food Organics
* Glass
* Metal
* Miscellaneous Trash
* Paper
* Plastic
* Textile Trash
* Vegetation
## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to classify images of waste items using a tf.keras.Sequential model. It leverages tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory to load and manage the dataset.

## Key concepts covered include:

* Efficient Dataset Loading.

* Overfitting Detection and Mitigation: Strategies to identify and address overfitting, including the use of dropout layers.

## Workflow:
* Data Exploration
* Data Preprocessing
* Model Building
* Model Training
* Model Evaluation
* Model Improvement

This Project serves as a guide through the basic steps of machine learning, from initial data examination to model enhancement.
